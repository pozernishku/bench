Get acquainted with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) 

Tutorial: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/

https://example.com/items/foo
...the path would be:

/items/foo

A "path" is also commonly called an "endpoint" or a "route".
While building an API, the "path" is the main way to separate "concerns" and "resources".

Normally you use:

POST: to create data.
GET: to read data.
PUT: to update data.
DELETE: to delete data.
So, in OpenAPI, each of the HTTP methods is called an "operation".
